# 🛡️ SkyGuardian – Autonomous Emergency Response Drone

# 🚀 Project Overview
**SkyGuardian** is an AI-enabled autonomous drone system designed to respond instantly during emergencies. Upon receiving an SOS signal, the drone autonomously takes off, navigates to the live GPS location, and provides **real-time aerial surveillance**, **two-way voice communication**, and **facial recognition**. It is built for deployment in campuses, gated communities, and public spaces to reduce emergency response time and enhance safety infrastructure.

# ❗ Problem Statement
Current emergency response systems often suffer from delayed action, manual triggers, and lack of real-time visibility. Victims in distress — especially women — are left waiting without help in critical moments. Traditional apps and wearables are limited by network issues and human input. **SkyGuardian** addresses this by autonomously reaching the scene with visual, audio, and location intelligence — effectively bridging the gap between SOS and action.

# 🔩 Hardware Components Used
- Raspberry Pi 4 (with camera module for live video + facial recognition)
- KK 2.1.5 Flight Controller (prototype) / Cube Orange (planned)
- 4S LiPo Battery (5200mAh)
- GPS Module (u-blox)
- Telemetry Radio (for remote ground communication)
- ESCs, BLDC Motors, Drone Frame
- Night Vision + Thermal Camera Module (planned upgrade)
- Mic + Speaker module (for 2-way voice communication)

# 💻 Planned Software Features
- Real-time facial recognition using OpenCV and TensorFlow
- GPS-based autonomous navigation via MAVLink
- Two-way voice communication system (via Pi + speaker/mic)
- Live HD video streaming via cloud dashboard
- Web dashboard for live tracking and system logs
- Threat classification & sensor analytics (phase II)
- SOS trigger via mobile app/web interface (future scope)

 # ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Prototype flight-tested (basic navigation and video stream)
- ✅ 3D model and hardware integration completed
- 🚧 Facial recognition integration in progress
- 🚧 Dashboard development in progress
- 🚧 GPS + autonomous navigation via Cube Orange in next phase


# 📌 Planned Deployment

- Phase 1: Pilot tests in gated communities and college campuses  
- Phase 2: Smart City partnership and emergency authority integration  
- Phase 3: Integration with government safety systems and scalable production
